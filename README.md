A Library for a Finance Tracking Program for helping the user keep track of my expenses, earnings, etc. with simple categorization, debt and credit tracking, and accounting.

The goal is supposed to be simplicity, reliability, and flexibility (without the hassle and overcomplications of most money manager and expense tracker apps out there).

It should also ideally contain a configurable import system (format) to be able to add previously recorded expenses (e.g., from a text file).

It is made with .NET 9 and Microsoft SQLite package.

It is mostly done and I'll at most add some methods to make queries easier or to make minor changes.

I've also added unit tests.

The only thing left is to use this Library in the actual program. 

Let me know what you think of it.
